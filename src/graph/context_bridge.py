"""AgentCore Platform v1.0"""

# Caller-request bridge across the outer/inner graph boundary.
#
# Why it exists: the framework invokes a nested graph as
# `subgraph.invoke(user_input, session_id=..., ctx=...)`. Only the request
# string crosses — neither the outer state nor the caller's structured
# invocation parameters are forwarded. So the validated contract the
# pre_process node produces (ministry selection, period label, and the caller's
# own policy documents) would never reach the digest pipeline on its own.
#
# The two sanctioned subclass hooks bridge it:
#
#   PolicyDigestGraphNode.extract_input(state)   [runs BEFORE subgraph.invoke]
#       -> set_request_contract(<validated contract>)
#   DomainWorkflowGraph._extra_initial_state()   [runs INSIDE subgraph.invoke]
#       -> seeds the contract into the inner state
#
# What crosses is the VALIDATED contract only — every value has already passed
# its bounded, inert shape check. The raw request body never travels.
#
# Packing the documents into the request string instead is not viable: the
# framework masks that field at every node boundary, so real document text
# would arrive partly rewritten and the digest would summarise corrupted input.
# This channel is not masked.
#
# A ContextVar keeps the hand-off correct per thread and per task, so
# concurrent invocations inside one process cannot see each other's request.
